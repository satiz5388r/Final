Exercise-3	Redis Troubleshooting Steps

A short description of your troubleshooting process.

I am login in redis server through by Ssh pemkey or putty ppk file wrong in this means it wonâ€™t connect the server. Sometime internet connection issues and particular server ip address is its not matching into our server, and  latency is the maximum delay between the time a client issues a command and the time the reply to the command is received by the client. see  briefly explains it she below:

	Measuring latency
-	If you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure it in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very evident even macroscopically.
	Latency baseline
	Latency induced by network and communication
	Single threaded nature of Redis
	Latency generated by slow commands
	Latency generated by fork
         Latency induced by swapping (operating system paging)
	Latency due to AOF and disk I/O
	Redis software watchdog.

Tell us what's wrong:
                   May be is not installed in our Machine. Memory Related Issue.
	        You should stop the current instance 
	        May Be its not installed in the extact location .
	        I want to allow remote connection, that is why I also bind to "external" IP. Is this causing redis to fail startup

Explain what you did to fix it:

Step 1: sudo service redis-server reload

Step 2 : sudo service redis-server start

Setup 3: sudo systemctl status redis-server

Step 4 :, redis-cli -h host_url -p 6379 ping

step 5: ps -ef |grep redis

step 6: kill -9 <4995>

step 7 : service redis restart

step 8 :service redis status

Based on error i will fix it .

redis-server.service: PID file /var/run/redis/redis.pid not readable (yet?) after start: No such file or directory

I've attempted to correct this by making sure that /var/run/redis/ is already created. I've also made sure that (at separate times) that /var/run/redis/ was owned by redis:redis and also redis:www-data (my apache2 group). I've also attempted many permissions schemes of 777, 755, 775, 007, 770.

In my case , the log directory (/var/log/redis) which I mention in /etc/redis/redis.conf file was not present


How I find the error

Try

vim /etc/systemd/system/redis.service

Type=forking
Memory issues: 

Measuring latency
redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`

Latency baseline

./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100 


echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

Latency induced by swapping (operating system paging)

redis-cli info | grep process_id

vmstat 1 iostat -xk 1

Memory Related Issuse

Step1: memory usage <key>

Steps 2: memory stats

memory malloc-stats provides an internal statistics report from jemalloc, the memory allocator used by Redis on Linux systems:

Step3: memory malloc-stats
Step4 : monitor

Step 5 : info
